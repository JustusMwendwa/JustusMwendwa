👩‍💻 Hey there, I'm Justo — your friendly neighborhood bug whisperer 🐛✨
Coffee-powered ☕, code-obsessed 💻 and currently in a committed relationship with my keyboard (don’t tell my IDE 😅). I turn caffeine into code, chaos into clean UIs and Stack Overflow tabs into solutions (most of the time).

💫 About Me:
🧠 Software Engineer | 🧩 Problem Solver | 💡 Tech Enthusiast
🚀 Passionate about creating clean, efficient, and scalable software solutions.
🌐 Specialized in web development, Android development, and machine learning — always hungry to learn more.
🛠️ Git is my sidekick. Ctrl + Z is my emergency escape.
🌱 I believe bugs are just misunderstood features... until they crash production 😅
💬 Always open to collaborating on cool projects or talking about anything tech — or memes.
🧁 Fun fact: I write code that sometimes works on the first try... by accident.
